# Hi! I'm Abhishek Pathak.

I'm a software engineer. I live in Bangalore, India. 

You might find me as `@4abhishekpathak` on the interweb.

I work at [Airbase](https://www.airbase.com) where I focus mainly on developing backend systems, along with leading observability and scalability initiatives.

Since 2011, this site has been my consistent home for sharing the most [relevant information](https://nownownow.com/about) about me in a noisy web.

Feel free to look around!
