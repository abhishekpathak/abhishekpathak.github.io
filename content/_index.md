# Hi! I'm Abhishek Pathak.

I'm a software engineer. I live in Bangalore, India. 

You might find me as `@4abhishekpathak` on the interweb.

I work at [Airbase](https://www.airbase.com) where I focus mainly on developing backend systems, along with handling observability and scalability.

This site has been around in one avatar or the other since ~2011. I keep it mainly to organise [useful](https://nownownow.com/about) information about me.

<!-- I've also been [blogging](/blog) since ~2007, although it has become rarer over the years. -->

Feel free to look around!
