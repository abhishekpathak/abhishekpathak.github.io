I am a programmer with 5 years of industry experience, and wish to present my application for the open research scientist position at Komli.
I have an engineering degree from IIT Kanpur, widely considered as one of the best grad schools in India.
I'm currently a part of the ads platform tech team at Flipkart, where I design and develop microservices using RESTful APIs.I've also learnt a lot of nuances of the advertising domain.
Before that, I helped develop the data platform at goibibo.com, a startup that is now the 2nd biggest travel website in India. I was the first member of the data team that has now grown to 6, and my roles varied from bootstrapping and writing code, to mentorship, leadership and brainstorming business decisions. I set up data pipelines, built monitoring tools and developed a BI framework from scratch (github.com/goibibo/gandalf). I also developed algorithms for doing predictive analytics, user profiling, segmentation etc.
I am proficient in Java, Python, Hadoop, SQL and NoSQL. I have been repeatedly recongnised for my skills of collaborating with diverse teams, tackling complex, unformulated problems and being an excellent mentor.
As a natural next step, I would love to explore machine learning/decision sciences. However, I seem to have hit a glass ceiling looking for challenging projects.I am eagerly looking to learn. I know the problems you guys are working on - and I know that this is the best place to satisfy my nerd-itch -and more importantly, learn.
Komli Media is known to tackle some of the most genuinly interesting problems out there, and I want to contribute, to learn, to enjoy. I will bring to the table a skill set that is extremely relevant, excellent interpersonal skills and a genuine curiosity for knowledge.
If my profile seems a right fit, I can be reached on +91-9019187698/me@abhishekpathak.net to take this discussion forward. I currently live and work in Bangalore, India.
Sincerely,
Abhishek Pathak
