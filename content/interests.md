# Interests

- **History** - My fascination has grown as I have. History takes us on a fantastic ride to a different era - with different beliefs and "truths". Its also like a secret, magical mirror - looking back often helps predict the future.

- **Productivity** - Ironically, my favourite procrastination.

- **Artificial Intelligence** - This has been my draw as far back as I remember. This is what got me interested in Computers. Replicating the human brain, with all its memory, consciousness and emotions - that's the dream.

- **Cultural diversity** - I love to explore, and in general think about the deep richness and variety across cultures. And then contrast it with the unifying layer - DNA, which dictates us to the same primal instincts.

- **Physics of the universe** - Particularly quantum physics, relativity annd interstellar space.

- **The Unix design principles** - I look to this whenever I find myself in a sprawling project.

- **Classic Rock. Music with good lyrics.** - Most of the songs of Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Kishore Kumar and Jagjit Singh appeal to me.
