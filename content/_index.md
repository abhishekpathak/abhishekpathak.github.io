# Hi, I'm Abhishek Pathak.

I'm a software engineer. I live in Bangalore, India. 

You can usually find me as `@4abhishekpathak` online.

Since 2020, I’ve been at [Airbase](https://www.airbase.com), where these days I work on scalability and observability of our backend systems.

This site’s been around in one form or another since 2011 — and I try to keep it updated with [what I'm up to](https://nownownow.com/about).

Feel free to look around!
