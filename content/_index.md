# Hi! I'm Abhishek Pathak.

I'm a software engineer. I live in Bangalore, India. 

You might find me as `@4abhishekpathak` on the interweb.

I've been with [Airbase](https://www.airbase.com) since 2020, where I helped build the core backend systems and am now focused on shaping our scalability and observability initiatives.

This site’s been around since 2011 — and I try to keep it updated with [what I'm up to](https://nownownow.com/about).

Feel free to look around!
